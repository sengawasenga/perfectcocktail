# Perfect Cocktail

Perfect Cocktail is an application that allows you to have a look on different recipes for a various number of drinks all around the world.
I built this project in order for me just to refresh my JavaScript knowledge, and work on more modern JavaScript features.

## Core features

The app consist of 4 core features:

* Display recipes into 4 different HTML files
* Consume different endpoints from the REST API based Drink name, category, ingredient and alcohol/non alcohol drink 
* Use modern JavaScript techniques such as Classes, Async/Await, Fetch API and more
* Allow the visitor to save and remove recipes from Local Storage

## Tech stack

For the tech stack, we used only 3 most used obvious technologies for front-end projects.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
